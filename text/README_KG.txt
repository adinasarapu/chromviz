The University of California Santa Cruz (UCSC) Known Genes data set is constructed by a fully automated process, based on protein data from Swiss-Prot/TrEMBL(UniProt) and the associated mRNA data from Genbank. The detailed steps of this process are described. Extensive cross-references from this data set to other genomic and proteomic data were constructed. For each known gene, a details page is provided containing rich information about the gene, together with extensive links to other relevant genomic, proteomic, and pathway data.
