The UCSD-Nature Signaling Gateway Molecule Pages provide essential information on more than 3900 proteins involved in cellular signaling. Each Molecule Page contains regularly updated information derived from public data sources as well as sequence analysis, references and links to other databases. Published Molecule Pages contain an expert-authored review article that describes the biological activity, regulation and localization of the protein. This review is supplemented by highly structured data that illustrate protein-protein interactions, post-translational modifications, subcellular localization and biological function.
